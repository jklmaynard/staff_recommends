WALLACE BOOKS STAFF RECOMMENDS
A Ruby App


For my personal project at the end of our Ruby coursework, I chose to make a staff recommends page that allows users to add books to their page, including a genre, and allow search through books using with genre or staff.  This is a simple web app I wanted to do to better understand get/post routes, and how those routes work together.  Styling is minor.
